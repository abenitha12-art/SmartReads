# SmartReads Online Book Store

## Project Description
SmartReads is a frontend online bookstore website created using HTML and Tailwind CSS. 
The website allows users to browse books, view featured books, create an account, log in, and view a shopping cart layout.

This project focuses on building a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.



## Pages Included
- Home Page
- Books Page
- Cart Page
- Login Page
- Sign Up Page
- Admin Dashboard

## Objectives
- Create a modern responsive UI
- Implement multiple pages (Home, Books, Cart, Admin, Login, Sign Up)
- Apply Tailwind CSS styling
- Design prototype using Figma
- Demonstrate 3 user roles (Admin, Customer1, Customer2)
## Data Source

The data used in this project comes from the following sources:

### 1. Static HTML Content
All book titles, prices, and categories are manually written inside the HTML files.  
This is the main data source of the website.

### 2. Book Cover Images
Book cover images are stored locally in the project folder (for example: 1.jpeg, 2.jpeg, 3.jpeg, etc.).  
These images are used to visually represent each book displayed on the website.

### 3. User Interface Forms
The Login and Sign Up forms are created for demonstration purposes.  
User information is not stored in a database since this project does not include backend development.

### 4. Admin Dashboard
The Admin Dashboard includes a form to add books.  
This section is designed to demonstrate how an admin panel would look in a complete system, but it does not store or process data.

### 5. Design Reference
The website layout and interface were first designed in Figma before being developed using HTML and Tailwind CSS.  
The Figma prototype helped guide the structure, spacing, and color theme of the final website.
